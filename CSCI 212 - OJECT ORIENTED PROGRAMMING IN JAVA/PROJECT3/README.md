Create a File Menu in your GUI Add a file menu to your ClockGUI with options to open any file for reading (and displaying the file as in Project 2), and one to Quit the program. You will need a FileMenuHandler class to handle the events from the FileMenu. Be sure to use getAbsolutePath() when getting the file from the JFileChooser, not getName(). Handle Exceptions A data file will be provided that will contain errors (e.g., hours > 23, minutes > 59, seconds > 59). Create and exception called IllegalClockException (by extending IlegalArgumentException as shown in lecture) and have the constructor of the Clock throw it. Use a try/catch statement to catch this exception in your program, and print the erroneous clock to the console (do not add it to the linked lists). Create a jar file called Project3.jar
