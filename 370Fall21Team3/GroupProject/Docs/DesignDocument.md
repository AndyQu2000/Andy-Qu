## 1 Design Considerations


### 1.1 Assumptions


The app will depend on the database for the storing of all reminders. The app will also depend on the Userâ€™s input to create reminders and/or edit and delete if need be.

### 1.2 Constraints


Adding a new reminder and making it visible as well as constrained to the other elements in the activity may prove to be a challenge. 



### 1.3 System Environment


The user must have an android device that can run android apps and must be API level 21 or above. 

## 2 Architectural Design



### 2.1 Component Diagram

### 2.2 Deployment Diagram



A deployment diagram is unnecessary. Everything that the reminder needs will be in the main application.

## 3 Low-Level Design
