A mashup between two api.

ACCUWEATHER AUTH - APIKEY

EVIL INSULT GENERATOR - PUBLIC

The goal of this project was to combine 2 apis and use them asynchronously by using call backs and other various methods. This project takes a long and lat of the user's location. After it directs you to a page that insults you because of your location.

This website is used on a local ip port 3000.
